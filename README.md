# VERBS Rust Examples

Examples of Ethereum simulations implemented
using the [VERBS](https://github.com/simtopia/verbs) rust library.

This is a demonstration of the use of VERBS as a purely Rust library,
in comparison to the Python API examples found 
[here](https://github.com/simtopia/verbs-examples).

Full documentation for the Rust API can be found 
[here](https://docs.rs/verbs-rs/latest/verbs_rs/).

## Running

The example can be run from the CI using cargo, running

```
cargo run --release -- --help
```

will show the program arguments.
